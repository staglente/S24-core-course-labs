#### Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.
- Ordering guarantees are unnecessary for my app because the app is designed to be stateless and does not rely on any specific order of operations. Each instance of the app can function independently and process requests in parallel without needing to wait for other instances to complete their tasks. This allows for more efficient utilization of resources and better scalability. Therefore, updates or changes to the StatefulSet can be applied in parallel without the need for strict ordering guarantees.
